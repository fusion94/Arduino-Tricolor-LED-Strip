### Overview
The [RadioShack Tricolor LED Strip](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=22128606) gives you 1 meter of programmable LED fun. Even better, each 10cm segment features its own integrated circuit (IC) so you can cut the strip into (up to) ten segments. Create different shapes and then tweak the ICs to change the colors and flash rates.

To get started, youâ€™ll need an Arduino board or other microcontroller, a soldering iron, some hookup wire, and a 12V 1A DC power source with a 5.5mm barrel plug.
